# Oriented Matroids

This package contains an oriented matroid implementation for sagemath.

## Installation

### Local install from source
Download the source from the git repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/thecaligarmo/oriented_matroids.git`

Change to the root directory and run:

`$ sage -pip install .`

For convenience this package contains a makefile with this and other often used commands. Should you wish too, you can use the shorthand:

`$ make install`

Note that you might need to alter the make file in order for this to run properly if your sage is located in another directory.
